# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component is responsible for provisioning an [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) Network File System with KMS
  encryption-at-rest. EFS is an excellent choice as the default block storage for EKS clusters so that volumes are not
  zone-locked.
